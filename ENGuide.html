    <p><font face="arial" size="3">2. When your screen gets all foggy, get away from the boss to the assigned spot. Assigned spot is likely the center of the room.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="3">3. Rigth before Ursoc uses Barrling Impact if you are assigned by raidleader to stand infront of the boss do it, but don't if you already have Momentum debuff.</font></p>
